# CNC Turning Operations Program

This repository contains a CNC program for executing a series of turning operations on a CNC machine. The program is written in G-code, a standard programming language used for CNC machines. It includes step turning, threading, grooving, and tapering operations to shape the workpiece.

## Features

- Step Turning: The program performs step turning by taking multiple cuts along the X-axis, gradually reducing the workpiece's diameter.
- Threading: It includes threading operations to create threads on the workpiece. The thread parameters like pitch and taper can be easily adjusted.
- Grooving: The program executes grooving operations on the workpiece, creating desired grooves with specified depths.
- Tapering: It performs tapering operations, gradually changing the workpiece's diameter along the X-axis.


## Acknowledgments

The G-code for the CNC program was generated using standard CNC programming techniques and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
